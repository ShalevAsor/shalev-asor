## Overview

Most developer portfolios are boring - just a list of projects with brief descriptions. I wanted something better. This portfolio turns project documentation into an experience with custom MDX components, interactive examples, and detailed technical breakdowns.

**Why this approach?** Most portfolios say "I built an e-commerce site with Next.js and Stripe." Cool, but how? This portfolio explains the technical challenges, architectural decisions, and interesting solutions. It's a portfolio that actually demonstrates technical depth.

## Tech Stack

<TechStack
  items={[
    "Next.js 15 with App Router for static generation",
    "TypeScript for type safety",
    "Velite for MDX content management with type generation",
    "Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system",
    "Custom MDX components for rich documentation",
    "rehype-pretty-code for syntax highlighting",
    "rehype-slug + rehype-autolink-headings for heading links",
    "React Server Components for optimal performance",
  ]}
/>

## Custom MDX Components

The real value of this portfolio is the component system. Instead of writing HTML or plain markdown, I built reusable components that make documentation beautiful and interactive.

<FeatureList>
  <Feature title="Content Components">
    **Callout** - Highlight important information with 4 types (info, success,
    warning, tip) **Collapse** - Collapsible sections for long technical details
    **Quote** - Customer testimonials or impactful quotes **Tabs** - Organize
    tech stack or multiple code examples
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Code & Technical">
    **TechStack** - Bulleted lists with proper formatting **FileTree** - Display
    project structure visually **ProcessFlow** - Show sequential steps (vertical
    or compact) **UserFlow** - Visual flowcharts with numbered steps
    **UserFlowGrouped** - Multi-phase workflows (this is new!)
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Visual Components">
    **Figure** - Single image with caption and lightbox **ImageGallery** - Grid
    of images (2-4 columns) with lightbox **ImageComparison** - Before/after
    comparisons **Stats** - Key metrics display in grid **StatCard** -
    Individual metric with trend indicator
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Project Documentation">
    **Challenge** - Problem/Solution/Result pattern for technical challenges
    **Step** - Step-by-step processes with numbered circles **FeatureList +
    Feature** - Detailed feature descriptions with icons **FeatureGrid +
    FeatureCard** - Grid layout for features
  </Feature>
</FeatureList>

## How It Works

<Collapse title="Velite + MDX Pipeline">

**1. Content Management**

Projects live in `src/content/projects/*.mdx`. Velite processes them at build time:

```typescript
// velite.config.mts
export default defineConfig({
  collections: {
    projects: {
      pattern: "projects/**/*.mdx",
      schema: s.object({
        title: s.string(),
        slug: s.slug("projects"),
        description: s.string(),
        date: s.isodate(),
        published: s.boolean(),
        featured: s.boolean(),
        tags: s.array(s.string()),
        github: s.string().url().optional(),
        demo: s.string().url().optional(),
        // ... more fields
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

Velite generates:

- TypeScript types in `.velite/index.d.ts`
- JSON data in `.velite/projects.json`
- Automatic slug validation and permalink generation

**2. MDX Processing**

Each MDX file goes through rehype plugins:

- **rehype-slug** - Adds IDs to headings
- **rehype-pretty-code** - Syntax highlighting with One Dark Pro theme
- **rehype-autolink-headings** - Makes headings clickable

**3. Component Mapping**

Custom components are mapped to MDX in `MDXContent.tsx`:

```typescript
const mdxComponents = {
  Callout,
  Collapse,
  TechStack,
  Challenge,
  // ... 20+ custom components

  // Override default HTML
  h2: (props) => (
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12" {...props} />
  ),
  code: (props) => (
    <code className="bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded" {...props} />
  ),
};
```

**4. Static Generation**

Next.js generates static pages at build time:

- `/` - Homepage
- `/projects` - Project listing
- `/projects/[slug]` - Individual project pages

Result: Fast, SEO-friendly, no runtime processing.

</Collapse>

## Project Page Structure

Every project follows the same structure for consistency:

<ProcessFlow
  variant="compact"
  steps={[
    "Overview with Stats callout",
    "Tech Stack in Tabs (Frontend/Backend/DevOps)",
    "Core Features with FeatureList",
    "Architecture explanation with FileTree",
    "Database schema in Collapse",
    "User journey with UserFlowGrouped",
    "Technical Challenges with Challenge components",
    "Performance optimizations with FeatureGrid",
    "Learning outcomes and future enhancements",
    "Conclusion with key takeaways",
  ]}
/>

This structure tells a complete story: what it does, how it's built, what problems it solves, and what I learned.

## Design Decisions

<FeatureGrid>
  <FeatureCard title="Velite over Contentlayer">
    Velite is lighter, faster, and actively maintained. Contentlayer was
    abandoned. Velite's API is cleaner and TypeScript support is better.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Custom Components over Templates">
    Building components once means every project page is consistent. Adding a
    new project is just writing MDX - no styling or layout decisions.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Static Generation">
    All projects are static HTML at build time. Fast page loads, great SEO,
    works with JavaScript disabled. Perfect for a portfolio.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="One Dark Pro Theme">
    Developers recognize this theme from VS Code. Syntax highlighting feels
    familiar and professional.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="No Database">
    Content is markdown files in git. Changes are tracked in version control. No
    CMS needed. Simpler deployment.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Server Components">
    Everything is a Server Component by default. Client components only for
    interactivity (modals, carousels). Better performance.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

## The UserFlowGrouped Story

<Collapse title="Why I Built This Component">

**The Problem:**

The original `UserFlow` component displayed flows vertically with arrows between steps. For projects with 20-30 steps (like Tale By You's checkout flow), it was way too long. Users had to scroll forever.

**First Solution - Horizontal Timeline:**

I created `UserFlowTimeline` with horizontal scrolling cards. Better, but still not ideal for very long flows.

**Final Solution - UserFlowGrouped:**

Group steps into collapsible phases:

```tsx
<UserFlowGrouped
  phases={[
    {
      title: "Template Selection",
      icon: "📝",
      steps: [
        "Browse templates",
        "Select template",
        // ... more steps
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "AI Generation",
      icon: "🎨",
      steps: [
        "Generate images",
        "Process results",
        // ... more steps
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Users see 4-5 phase headers. Click to expand details. **Much more compact** while still showing the complete flow.

This is a perfect example of iterating on portfolio components based on real needs.

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me:

<TechStack
  items={[
    "MDX is powerful for rich content - way better than plain markdown",
    "Component systems make documentation consistent and maintainable",
    "Velite's type generation catches content errors at build time",
    "Static generation is perfect for portfolios - fast and SEO-friendly",
    "Iterating on components based on usage improves the system",
    "Writing detailed project docs helps me understand my own work better",
  ]}
/>

## Why This Matters

Most portfolios are resumes with links. This portfolio is **proof of technical depth**. When I say "I built a Discord clone with a custom WebSocket server," you can read exactly how:

- Why I built my own instead of using Socket.io
- How I solved race conditions
- What the architecture looks like
- The actual code patterns I used

That's way more valuable than "Discord Clone - Next.js, WebSocket, MongoDB."

## Conclusion

This portfolio is a template for technical documentation. The custom components make it easy to add new projects with consistent, high-quality documentation. Writing these detailed project pages also helps me understand my own work better - explaining something forces you to understand it deeply.

<Callout type="success" title="Recursive?">
  This very page you're reading was written using the same MDX components and
  Velite pipeline. The portfolio documents itself using its own system. That's
  pretty cool.
</Callout>

If you're building a portfolio, steal this approach. Build a component system, write detailed docs, show your technical depth. Way better than a list of project cards.
