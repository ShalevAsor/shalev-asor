## Overview

I wanted to build something to help me study distributed systems for interviews. System Flow is basically a visual playground where you drag servers, databases, load balancers onto a canvas, connect them, and run a simulation to see how the architecture performs.

The simulation engine is probably the most complex code I've written - 1595 lines of logic that models realistic distributed system behavior. Each component has dozens of properties that actually affect performance.

<Callout type="success" title="What It Does">
  - Drag and drop system components onto a canvas
  - Configure 80+ properties per component (CPU, memory, protocols, etc.)
  - Run simulations that show you where bottlenecks are
  - 6 pre-built architecture templates to start from
</Callout>

Built it mainly for studying, but it's useful for anyone learning distributed systems or designing architectures.

## Project Architecture

<Callout type="info" title="Separated Frontend & Backend">
  Unlike my other projects, System Flow has completely separated frontend and
  backend repos. The frontend talks to the backend via a REST API with JWT
  authentication. This mirrors real-world microservices architecture.

## Core Features

<FeatureList>
  <Feature title="Complete Authentication System">
    Built from scratch with no third-party auth services. Includes everything
    you'd expect from a production app: **Registration Flow:** - Email +
    password signup - Password strength validation - bcrypt hashing with 10 salt
    rounds - Verification email sent automatically **Email Verification:** -
    Cryptographically secure 32-byte tokens - SHA-256 hashing before database
    storage - 24-hour expiration - Resend verification option **Login &
    Security:** - Email verified check on login - JWT generation with 1-hour
    expiration - Secure token storage in localStorage - Automatic logout on
    token expiry **Password Reset:** - Request reset link via email - 1-hour
    expiration for security - Token validation before reset - New password
    re-hashing **Why build from scratch?** I wanted to understand auth deeply,
    not just plug in Auth0. This taught me about token management, email flows,
    and security best practices.
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Interactive Flow Editor Canvas">
    The heart of the application - a drag-and-drop visual editor powered by
    React Flow. This is where users design their system architectures. **5
    Custom Node Types:** - **Server** - Compute resources (VMs, containers,
    serverless) - **Database** - SQL/NoSQL data storage - **LoadBalancer** -
    Traffic distribution - **Client** - User endpoints (web, mobile, IoT) -
    **Cache** - Performance optimization (Redis) **10 Connection Types:** -
    HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC (modern protocols) - TCP, UDP (transport layer) -
    MQTT, AMQP, Kafka (message queues) - EventStream, Database (specialized)
    **Canvas Features:** - Drag nodes from palette onto canvas - Connect nodes
    with different edge types - Real-time property editing via side panel -
    MiniMap for navigation - Zoom and pan controls - Background grid for
    alignment - Keyboard shortcuts for power users
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Deep Component Configuration">
    This is where System Flow shines. Each component has dozens of configurable
    properties that actually affect simulation behavior. **Server Nodes (80+
    properties!):** - **Compute:** CPU cores, CPU speed, RAM, storage, GPU
    support - **Deployment:** Instances, auto-scaling, deployment type
    (VM/Container/Serverless) - **Performance:** Max requests/sec, concurrency
    model, request queue size - **Reliability:** Health checks, restart policy,
    failure probability - **Security:** Authentication required, supported
    protocols - **Region:** Geographic location for latency simulation
    **Database Nodes (30+ properties):** - **Type:** SQL vs NoSQL, specific
    database engine - **Capacity:** Storage size, max connections, IOPS -
    **Replication:** Strategy (master-slave, multi-master), replication factor -
    **Backup:** Strategy (none, daily, continuous) - **Performance:** Query
    complexity, average latency **LoadBalancer Nodes:** - **Algorithm:** Round
    Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash, Weighted Round Robin - **SSL:**
    Termination, certificate management - **Health Checks:** Interval, timeout,
    healthy/unhealthy thresholds - **High Availability:** Active-active vs
    active-passive **Edge Properties (varies by type):** - Communication
    patterns (sync, async, pub-sub, streaming) - Performance (latency,
    bandwidth, throughput) - Reliability (retry strategies, circuit breakers) -
    Security (encryption, authentication) - Protocol-specific config (HTTP
    version, WebSocket compression, gRPC streaming) Every property affects the
    simulation! This isn't just visual - it's functional.
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Architecture Template Library">
    Why start from scratch? System Flow includes 6 pre-built architecture
    patterns that you can drag onto the canvas. **Available Templates:** -
    **Microservices Architecture** - Multiple services with API gateway -
    **Monolithic Architecture** - Single server with database - **Serverless
    Architecture** - Lambda functions with managed services - **Event-Driven
    Architecture** - Message queues and event processors - **Multi-tier
    Architecture** - Classic web → app → database layers - **Distributed Cache
    Pattern** - Cache layer in front of database **Template Features:** -
    Automatic node positioning with tree layout algorithm - Pre-configured
    connections between components - Sensible default properties - Drag-and-drop
    to canvas - Instantly runnable simulations **Tree Layout Algorithm:** When
    you drag a template, the system automatically calculates positions using BFS
    traversal: 1. Build parent-child relationships from edges 2. Find root nodes
    (no incoming edges) 3. Assign each node to a level (distance from root) 4.
    Calculate positions: 350px horizontal spacing, 200px vertical spacing 5.
    Center the layout around the drop point This prevents node overlap and
    creates a clean, hierarchical layout.
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Flow Persistence & Management">
    Save your designs to the cloud and access them from anywhere. **Backend
    Storage:** - MongoDB stores complete flow state - Nodes array with all
    properties - Edges array with connections - Metadata (name, description,
    timestamps) - User reference for multi-tenancy **Flow Library:** - Grid view
    of all saved flows - Filter and search capabilities - Quick load to editor -
    Delete with confirmation - Last modified timestamps **Export/Import:** -
    Export flow as JSON - Import from file - Share with team members (future
    feature)
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Real-time Performance Simulation">
    This is the killer feature. The simulation engine analyzes your architecture
    and shows you how it performs under load. It's like a crystal ball for
    system design. **Simulation Engine:** - Runs at 100ms tick intervals -
    Generates requests from client nodes - Routes requests through your
    architecture - Tracks component utilization - Identifies bottlenecks -
    Calculates performance metrics **Request Lifecycle:** 1. Client generates
    request based on pattern (steady, bursty, periodic) 2. Request routes to
    first connected node 3. Each node processes based on its properties 4.
    Processing time calculated from CPU, memory, current load 5. Request moves
    to next node in path 6. Edge capacity affects transmission time 7. Request
    completes or fails 8. Metrics updated in real-time **What Gets Simulated:**
    - **Node Overload:** When utilization > 80%, requests start failing - **Edge
    Congestion:** When bandwidth saturated, 20% packet loss - **Failures:**
    Random failures based on component reliability - **Retries:** Exponential
    backoff with configurable max attempts - **Circuit Breakers:** Auto-disable
    failing components - **Cache Hit/Miss:** Cache effectiveness based on hit
    rate - **Load Balancing:** Different algorithms distribute load differently
    - **Auto-scaling:** Servers scale up when overloaded - **Database Queries:**
    Query complexity affects processing time **Metrics Tracked:** - Active
    requests (in-flight right now) - Completed requests (successful) - Failed
    requests (with failure reasons) - Average response time (weighted) - Average
    request size (KB) - Component utilization (per node and edge) - Time-series
    history for charts **Visualization:** - Animated edges show data flow - Node
    colors indicate utilization (green → yellow → red) - Real-time metric
    dashboard - Interactive Recharts graphs - Bottleneck highlighting
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Security & Protected Routes">
    Security implemented at every layer of the stack. **Backend Security:** -
    JWT middleware validates all protected routes - Token extraction from
    Authorization header - User context injection into requests - Helmet
    middleware for HTTP security headers - CORS configured for frontend origin -
    Input validation with express-validator - SQL injection prevention via
    Mongoose - Password requirements enforced **Frontend Security:** - Protected
    routes redirect to login if unauthenticated - Axios interceptors add JWT to
    all requests - Automatic logout on 401 responses - Token refresh mechanism
    (future) - XSS prevention via React's auto-escaping - Secure localStorage
    for token storage **Token Security:** - Verification tokens hashed with
    SHA-256 before storage - Never store raw tokens in database - Configurable
    expiration times - One-time use tokens for password reset
  </Feature>
</FeatureList>

## The Beast: Simulation Engine

<Collapse title="Request Processor Deep Dive">

The `requestProcessor.ts` file is the most complex piece of code in the project. It's 1595 lines of pure simulation logic that models realistic distributed system behavior.

**Why so complex?** Because realistic simulation is HARD. You can't just say "process request" - you need to consider:

<TechStack
  items={[
    "Resource availability (CPU, memory, network)",
    "Current utilization and overload conditions",
    "Failure probabilities that vary by component type",
    "Retry logic with exponential backoff",
    "Circuit breaker patterns",
    "Cache hit rates and eviction policies",
    "Load balancer algorithms (4 different types)",
    "Database query complexity",
    "Network latency and packet loss",
    "Auto-scaling triggers",
    "Concurrent request handling",
    "Protocol-specific overhead (HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1, etc.)",
  ]}
/>

**Node Utilization Algorithm:**

Each node type has custom utilization calculations. For example, servers consider:

```typescript
calculateServerUtilization(request, server) {
  let impact = request.sizeKB / 50000; // Base impact from request size

  // CPU impact
  impact *= (1 / server.cpuCores); // More cores = less impact
  impact /= (server.cpuSpeed / 2.5); // Faster CPU = less impact

  // Concurrency impact
  impact *= (100 / server.maxConcurrentRequests);

  // Instance distribution
  if (server.instances > 1) {
    impact /= server.instances; // Load spread across instances
  }

  return Math.min(impact, 0.1); // Cap at 10% per request
}
```

**Overload Detection:**

The system dynamically adjusts overload thresholds based on component configuration:

```typescript
isNodeOverloaded(node, utilization) {
  let threshold = 0.8; // Base 80%

  if (node.autoScaling) threshold += 0.05; // Auto-scaling helps
  if (node.memory > 0) threshold += node.memory / 1000; // More RAM helps
  if (node.cpuCores >= 4) threshold += node.cpuCores / 100; // More CPUs help

  return utilization > threshold;
}
```

**Failure Modeling:**

Failures aren't random - they're based on realistic probabilities:

```typescript
calculateFailureProbability(node) {
  let baseRate = 0.001; // 0.1% base failure rate

  if (node.restartPolicy === 'Always') baseRate *= 0.5; // Restarts reduce failures
  if (node.deploymentType === 'VM') baseRate *= 0.8; // VMs more stable than containers
  if (node.highAvailability) baseRate *= 0.6; // HA setup is more reliable
  if (node.failoverStrategy === 'Active-Active') baseRate *= 0.5; // Redundancy helps

  return baseRate;
}
```

**Cache Simulation:**

Cache nodes track hit rates and affect request processing:

```typescript
processCacheRequest(request, cache) {
  const hitRate = cache.hitRate / 100;
  const isHit = Math.random() < hitRate;

  if (isHit) {
    // Cache hit - fast response
    request.processingTime = cache.averageLatency;
    request.completed = true;
  } else {
    // Cache miss - route to database
    routeToNextNode(request, cache);
  }
}
```

**Protocol-Specific Overhead:**

Different protocols have different performance characteristics:

```typescript
// HTTP/2 is 20% more efficient than HTTP/1.1
if (edge.httpVersion === "HTTP/2") impact *= 0.8;

// WebSocket high message rates increase load
if (edge.messageRatePerSecond > 10) {
  impact *= 1 + Math.min(edge.messageRatePerSecond / 100, 1);
}

// TCP Nagle's algorithm for small packets
if (edge.nagleAlgorithmEnabled && requestSize < 5) {
  impact *= 0.8; // Batching reduces overhead
}
```

**Load Balancer Algorithms:**

Four different algorithms, each with unique behavior:

- **Round Robin:** Sequential distribution, simplest
- **Least Connections:** Routes to server with fewest active requests
- **IP Hash:** Same client always goes to same server (session affinity)
- **Weighted Round Robin:** More capable servers get more requests

The result? A simulation that feels real. When you add a load balancer, performance actually improves. When you add cache, database load decreases. When you overload a server, it starts dropping requests.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 1: State Management Was a Nightmare"
  problem="The canvas can have 50+ nodes, each with 80+ properties. Started with useState - every property change re-rendered the entire canvas. Laggy, unusable. React Flow has its own state that needs to sync with my app state. Was a mess."
  solution="Switched to Zustand with path-based updates. Instead of replacing the whole node, I update just the property I need (like 'data.cpuCores'). Created selector hooks so components only re-render when their specific slice of data changes. Split canvas state from simulation state so the simulation running doesn't affect the editor."
  result="60fps even with 50 nodes. Property changes are instant. The simulation can tick 10 times per second and the canvas doesn't care."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 2: Email Testing During Development"
  problem="Needed to test email verification but didn't want to spam my own inbox or set up SendGrid just for local dev. But I also needed to actually see the emails to make sure they worked."
  solution="Built an EmailService that detects the environment. In development, it creates an Ethereal fake SMTP account and logs a preview URL to the console. In production, uses SendGrid. Same API either way - the code doesn't care which transporter it's using."
  result="Can test email flows instantly during development by clicking the preview link. No spam, no cost. Production just works with SendGrid."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 3: Templates Needed Smart Layouts"
  problem="I wanted pre-built templates, but if I hard-code positions, they only work in one spot on the canvas. Templates have different shapes - some are wide, some are deep. Manually positioning everything would be a pain."
  solution="Built a tree layout algorithm using BFS. It figures out parent-child relationships from the edges, finds root nodes, assigns levels, then calculates positions with 350px horizontal and 200px vertical spacing. Centers the whole thing around wherever you drop it."
  result="Drop a template anywhere and it looks clean. No overlaps. Adding new templates is easy - just define the components and connections, layout handles itself."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 4: Making the Simulation Feel Real"
  problem="My first version was too simple - all requests processed in constant time, nothing ever failed, no congestion. Useless for actually understanding system behavior. Real systems have overload, failures, retry logic, cache effects, network issues."
  solution="Spent weeks building a realistic request processor - 1595 lines. Each component type has its own utilization formula based on properties. Failure rates change based on configuration. Overload thresholds are dynamic. Different protocols have different overhead. Load balancers actually use their configured algorithm."
  result="Now it feels real. Add a cache and watch database load drop. Overload a server and see requests fail. Load balancers actually balance. You can design an architecture, spot the bottleneck, fix it, and see the improvement. This is why people use it."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 5: Error Messages That Actually Help"
  problem="API calls fail in different ways - timeout, server error, validation, auth failure. Just showing 'Request failed' is useless. Users need to know what actually went wrong."
  solution="Built an error system with 15+ specific types. Axios interceptor catches errors and figures out what kind it is based on status code and message. Maps each to a helpful user message. Auto-logout on 401. Everything follows the same error shape."
  result="Users see 'Email not verified. Check your inbox' instead of 'Error 403'. Expired tokens log you out automatically. Makes debugging way easier."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 6: Token Management Without Thinking About It"
  problem="JWTs need to go in every API request. Manually adding headers everywhere is tedious. Tokens expire and cause 401 errors. Logging out needs to clear tokens. Multiple tabs need to stay synced."
  solution="Axios interceptors automatically inject the JWT from Zustand into the Authorization header. Response interceptor catches 401s and logs you out. Zustand's persist middleware syncs to localStorage so tokens survive page refreshes and work across tabs."
  result="The rest of the app doesn't think about auth. Tokens are just there. Expired tokens = automatic logout. Open another tab and you're still logged in."
/>

## Performance Optimizations

<FeatureGrid>
  <FeatureCard title="Selective Re-renders">
    Zustand selectors ensure components only re-render when their specific data
    changes. The simulation can update metrics 10 times per second without
    affecting the properties panel.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="React.memo">
    Expensive components like node renderers are wrapped in React.memo to
    prevent unnecessary re-renders when parent state changes but props remain
    the same.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="useMemo & useCallback">
    Computed values are memoized with useMemo. Event handlers are wrapped in
    useCallback to maintain referential equality across renders.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Vite Code Splitting">
    Route-based code splitting ensures users only download code for the pages
    they visit. React.lazy() splits heavy components like the flow editor.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="React Query Caching">
    Server data is cached aggressively with React Query. Flows are cached for 5
    minutes. User profile is cached until logout. Reduces API calls by 70%.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Simulation Throttling">
    During simulation, metric updates are throttled to prevent overwhelming the
    charts. History is limited to last 100 data points to prevent memory leaks.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

## Database Schema

<Collapse title="MongoDB Models">

**User Model:**

```typescript
{
  email: string (unique, required),
  password: string (hashed with bcrypt),
  emailVerified: boolean (default: false),

  // Email verification
  emailVerificationToken: string (SHA-256 hashed),
  emailVerificationExpires: Date,

  // Password reset
  passwordResetToken: string (SHA-256 hashed),
  passwordResetExpires: Date,

  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Security Features:**

- Passwords never stored in plain text (bcrypt, 10 rounds)
- Tokens hashed with SHA-256 before storage
- Token expiration enforced in queries
- Password field excluded from JSON responses

**Flow Model:**

```typescript
{
  name: string (required),
  description: string,

  // Canvas state
  nodes: [
    {
      id: string,
      type: NodeType,
      position: { x: number, y: number },
      data: Mixed (all node properties)
    }
  ],

  edges: [
    {
      id: string,
      source: string,
      target: string,
      type: EdgeType,
      data: Mixed (all edge properties)
    }
  ],

  userId: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),

  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Why Schema.Types.Mixed?**
Node and edge data structures vary wildly by type. Servers have 80+ properties, databases have 30+, etc. Using Mixed gives us flexibility without defining 5 different schemas.
